Wiring of the tactile switch is set by default on GPIO 3 which is pin 5. 
The wiring can be changed by altering the "shutdown-listener.py" script.

How To:
# Using nano type the command [ sudo nano shutdown-listener.py ] 
while in the RPi_IO directory.
# Edit the lines that read:
    GPIO.setup(3, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)                 #Pins for I/O Button
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(3, GPIO.FALLING)
Change the number (in this case 3) to the GPIO that you want to use. 
# Press CTRL-X 
# Press Y to save changes
# Maunual Reboot with [ sudo reboot now ].
